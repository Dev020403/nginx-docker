# FAQ API with Caching and Translation
This project is a RESTful API for managing Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) with support for multiple languages and caching using Redis. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete FAQs, and automatically translates them into Hindi (`hi`) and Bengali (`bn`) using Google Translate.
